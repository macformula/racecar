# Binding CubeMX Peripherals to Firmware

!!! info

    This article assumes you are familiar with the [`racecar/` Architecture](../architecture/index.md).

    It uses the peripheral configuration from the [previous article](configure.md).

Open your `board_config.ioc` file in CubeMX and click "Generate Code." This will surround `board_config.ioc` with autogenerated files and folders containing C code which initializes the microcontroller using the graphical CubeMX configuration.

We must "lift" the generated C functions and variables into C++ and *bind* them to our firmware.

## Peripherals

A C++ peripheral is created by wrapping the generated variables in an MCAL peripheral class. Start by creating a new file `platforms/stm32f767/bindings.cc`.

### Digital Input/Output

### ADC

### CAN

### PWM

## Initialization

## CMake
