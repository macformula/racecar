# DemoAnalogPWM

This demonstrates the utility of PWMOutput class and AnalogOutput class through
their respective Set and Get methods

The classes were separated because PWM can be used for two different purposes:
    1. Output an analog voltage
    2. Output a digital signal with a specific frequency and duty cycle
