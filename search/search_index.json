Being able to arbitrarily swap platforms enables:</p> <ul> <li> Running vehicle firmware on your local machine through its command line interface.</li> <li> Testing application code with a HIL or SIL setup.</li> <li> Writing portable code, should we ever change our microcontroller.</li> <li> Simultaneously having multiple hardware configurations for the same platform.</li> </ul> <p>Platform abstraction means that each device executes the exact same application code. This greatly simplifies debugging:</p> <ul> <li>If there is a bug when running the vehicle but the test platform works fine, then you immediately know that the vehicle platform layer was configured incorrectly.</li> <li>If all platforms have the same bug, then you know that all hardware peripherals are responding and the bug exists at the app layer.</li> </ul> Debugging Example <p>Imagine you are creating a simple project to turn on an LED whenever a button is pressed (this is the purpose of the <code>Demo/BasicIO</code> project). There are four primary elements of this code:</p> <ol> <li>Read the button state (platform layer).</li> <li>Store the button state in a boolean variable (app).</li> <li>Set the LED with the boolean (platform).</li> <li>Loop to repeat this process indefinitely (app).</li> </ol> <p>Without platform abstraction, if the code \"didn't work\", then you would be wondering:</p> <ul> <li>Does my button circuit work?</li> <li>Is the variable being stored properly?</li> <li>Did I choose the right GPIO pins for the button and LED?</li> <li>Is the LED burnt out?</li> <li>Did my program crash and fail to loop?</li> </ul> <p>Addressing all of these potential errors would lead you down a long road of circuit testing and code modifications, trying to find other ways to see if the LED is working of if there was a crash.</p> <p>Now suppose that you have used platform abstraction. When your project doesn't work, you can quickly configure a CLI platform to emulate the physical button and LED. The button state is \"read\" by prompting for a <code>true</code>/<code>false</code> input and the LED state is \"set\" by printing a message to the screen.</p> <p>When you run the program in the CLI, you may find everything works as expected. When you type <code>true</code>, the program prints \"LED On\" and <code>false</code> causes \"LED Off\", and the program loops as expected. This indicates the the physical hardware was configured incorrectly.</p> <p>Or, maybe the CLI always prints \"LED Off\" regardless of your input. Now you know that there is an error in the app code. You inspect the app code because the error is independent of the platform configuration. </p>"},{"location":"firmware/architecture/#motivation-2-modular-logic","title":"Motivation 2: Modular Logic","text":"<p>Application behaviour can be completely defined without knowledge of the hardware setup, and vice-versa.
