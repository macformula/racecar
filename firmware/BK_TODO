- write a readme describing how to build (make PLATFORM=? ...)
- include instructions for creating a new project in the readme / documentation pdf (readme should be fine)

- finish TMS tasks, test with windows
- PR

Write lots of documentation
Explain the structure of the firmware directory
How to add peripherals
How to create a project
- maybe create a base project (or even use hello world) and go from there

How to create app objects that use references to peripherals

How to setup the cmake files
- if there is a base project, then most of this should be done already

TO INVESIGATE
modules
- could see then being useful for shared and mcal layers
- is there a way to do it for the cubemx code?

better cmake, remove compiler flags from bindings cmake file

try to use the cubemx autogen makefile and link to those -> this is far more robust
