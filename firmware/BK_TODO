Add command to convert .elf to .bin and flash

- verify that code builds, flashes, and runs binary switch for stm
- would be good to create a new project for this, kind of like a HelloWorld
	- stm uses on-board button
	- windows use y/n input

- remove default parameters from Makefile to enforce specification
- write a readme describing how to build (make PLATFORM=? ...)
- include instructions for creating a new project in the readme / documentation pdf (readme should be fine)

- finish TMS tasks, test with windows
- PR
