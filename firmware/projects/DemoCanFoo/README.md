# DemoCanFoo Project

The DemoCanFoo project is best suited for the `raspi` and the `stm32f767` platform. It sends dummy messages created for testing purposes. To observe the full system at work, run alongside the DemoCanBar project.

### Nodes:
`Foo` (this ecu)

`Bar` (some other ecu)

### Messages:

`Foo` sends `Bar` the `TempSensors` message.
