# Interrupt Handling Project

The Interrupt Handling project demonstrates how to implement interrupt handling in C++. It is designed to work on CLI platforms and provides an example of managing asynchronous events through signal interrupts.

### Key Components:
- **Bindings** (this module): Manages the interrupt logic and state control.
- **Main Application**: Contains the primary logic for handling interrupts.

### Functionality:
1. **Signal Handling**: The application listens for a specific signal (e.g., `Ctrl + C`) to trigger the interrupt.
2. **State Management**: Upon receiving the interrupt, it toggles a state variable to demonstrate the responsiveness of the application.

### How to Use:
To incorporate this project as an example in your own work:
- Review the structure of the `bindings` namespace.
- Modify the `AppLevelFunction` to define your interrupt behavior.
- Set up the interrupt handling by including `bindings.h` and calling `bindings::setup_interrupt()`.
