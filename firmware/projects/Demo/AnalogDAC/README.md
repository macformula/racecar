# DemoAnalogDAC

This demonstrates the utility of AnalogOutputDAC class through its SetVoltage
method.

We are using AnalogOutputDAC to generate an analog output voltage by using the
DAC peripheral on the stm32.

This is an alternative to using AnalogOutputPWM to generate an
analog output voltage by controlling the duty cycle of the PWM peripheral.
