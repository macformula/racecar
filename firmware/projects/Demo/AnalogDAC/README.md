# DemoAnalogDAC

This demonstrates the utility of AnalogOutputDAC class through its SetVoltage
method

We are using AnalogOutputDAC to generate an analog output voltage by using the
DAC peripheral on the stm32. 
This will have the same functionality of using AnalogOutputPWM to generate an
analog output voltage by controlling the duty cycle of the PWM peripheral.
