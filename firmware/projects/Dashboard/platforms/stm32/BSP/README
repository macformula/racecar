DO NOT USE THE LATEST VERSIONS
`cd` into each submodule and run `git status` to see which tag/commit we are using.

The latest versions (v2.X.X) of each submodule are not compatible.

At time of writing, we are using

32f469idiscovery-bsp v2.2.0
otm8009a v1.0.7
nt35510 v1.0.3

Both the otm and nt packages expect an external `_IO_DELAY(uint32_t)` method. This is defined in `32f469idiscovery-bsp/stm32469i_discovery.c`, but that file also expects us to use the I2C drivers, which we do not. We added the `io_delay.cc` to bypass this.
