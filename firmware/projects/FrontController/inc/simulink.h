 * @brief Provides an interface to the simulink model.
 * @todo Can this become a shared component? Maybe templated off of the i/o
 * struct types. Such an implementation would also need the initialize() and
 * step() functions bound in the project, since they could not be referenced
 * without a project-specific include.
 * For now, since there is only one model, this non-shared implemenation is
 * fine.
